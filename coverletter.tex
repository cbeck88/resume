\opening{To Whom It May Concern:} 

\noindent I'm writing to express my interest in holding a summer internship at IBM Research Almaden in 2013, and taking part in the vibrant and active research community at the Almaden Theory Group.
%\noindent PARAGRAPH ONE: State reason for letter, name the position or type 
%of work you are applying for and identify source from  which  you 
%learned   of   the  opening.  (i.e.  Career  Development  Center, 
%newspaper, employment service, personal contact). 
 
\noindent Please find attached a copy of my CV with publication list, list of references and contact information.

%\noindent In my position as a graduate student at Princeton, I have had the opportuntiy to learn from and work
%with world-renowned researchers at the University and at the Institute for Advanced Study. My research agenda has
%focused on making progress on classical questions in Computational Complexity, such as proving lower bounds
%on Time and Space in natural models of computation. My research has contributed new techniques for understanding the limitations of space-constrained computation, even for quantities of space which are much larger than the problem input,
%in rich models of computation which include popular and important algorithms such as modern SAT Solvers and Grobner basis techniques. I have also contributed to our understanding of the computational limits of small bounded-depth circuits, in terms of their inability to sample even approximately from simple and explicit distributions. Other areas I have explored include classical vs. quantum computation in settings such as communication complexity and oracle models, algebraic models of computation, and combinatorial group theory. I am interested broadly in the foundations 
%of computer science, and I especially enjoy theorems which blend combinatorial insight with insight from other areas
%such as geometry and logic. 

%\noindent I have had the opportunity to visit and work with researchers in several different communities, but the
%community at Almaden impresses me with both its scope and its depth. I believe my skills and experience
%are well matched to the strengths of this community, and that in the course of an internship I could make significant
%contributions to the effort to bring new techniques to bear on fundamental questions.

%\noindent PARAGRAPH  TWO:  Indicate why you are interested in the position, 
%the company, its products, services - above all, stress what  you 
%can  do  for  the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain 
%how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate  for 
%the  position.  If  you have practical work experience, point out 
%specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat 
%the  same  information  the reader will find in the resume. Refer 
%the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes 
%your  qualifications,  training,  and experiences. The purpose of 
%this section is to strengthen your resume  by  providing  details 
%which bring your experiences to life. 
 
\noindent Thank you for considering my application.

%\noindent PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and  indicate  your 
%flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in 
%the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For 
%example,  state that you will be in the city where the company is 
%located on a certain date and would like to set up an  interview. 
%Or,  state  that  you  will  call  on a certain date to set up an 
%interview. End the letter by thanking  the  employer  for  taking 
%time to consider your credentials. 
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
